Given RNA Seq file wt_1_f.fastq.qz

With the use of R file follwoing questions can be answered, 

What fraction of reads in give file has an A nucleotide in the 5th base of the read?
What is the average numeric quality value of the 5th base of these reads?
In given interval, how many reads are duplicated by position?
What is the absolute value of the log foldchange (logFC) of the gene with the lowest P.value.
How many genes are differentially expressed between the two groups at an adj.P.value cutoff of 0.05?
What is the mean difference in beta values between the 3 normal samples and the 3 cancer samples, across OpenSea CpGs?
How many of these DNase hypersensitive sites contain one or more CpGs on the 450k array?
How many features are differentially expressed between control and treatment (ie. padj <= 0.05)?
